## Projects
### Customer Targeting with Machine Learning
[Project detail](https://github.com/oakpongphon/Targeting_messages_usingML)

Utilized machine learning techniques to optimize customer targeting in marketing campaigns. Implemented logistic regression, neural networks, and random forests to improve profitability and Return on Marketing Expenditure (ROME) for high-end steakhouse and mobile app promotions.

### Shared Social Responsibility: A Field Experiment in Pay-What-You-Want Pricing and Charitable Giving
[Project detail]()

Evaluated the effectiveness of various pricing strategies, including flat-rate pricing (FR), flat-rate pricing with 50% of revenue donated to charity (FR charity), Name Your Own Price (NYOP), and Name Your Own Price with 50% of revenue to charity (NYOP charity). Utilizing **Python**, I conducted *hypothesis testing*, *means comparison*, *data manipulation*, and *visualizations* to assess the outcomes.

### ETL with Snowflake, SQL Project
[Project detail](https://github.com/oakpongphon/sql_proj)

Extract, transform and load data from 4 different formats: csv, XML, postgres and Snowflake Marketplace deploying **Python** including **SQL** codes embedded inside to execute.
